# Crime Fog's Zen Innovation Super Awesome List for the parasympathetic system

## Tea (extra foggy)

##### Ingredients: Harney and Sons Organic Moroccan Mint and White Christmas Tea. 

##### Tools: A metal tea kettle, ceramic tea kettle, ordinary pot, and water boiler / distiller / Keurig. 

##### Goal: Tasty green tea that is neither burnt, acidic, nor lukewarm.

##### Steps: Start while getting ready for work, process is 30-45 minutes.  

1) Run water through Keurig for a cup or two of hot (not coffee polluted) water, save it for 30+ minutes or less in the fridge.
2) Pour some of the lukewarm (or less warm) water into your ceramic pot.  It doesn't have to be an expensive one.

1) Drop in a smidge of [White Christmas tea](https://www.harney.com/products/white-christmas).  This will take the edge off the already polite mint green tea for those wary of strong overpowering matcha flavor.

1) Drop in a tablespoon or two of [Organic Moroccan Mint](https://www.harney.com/products/moroccan-mint).

1) Pour the other half of lukewarm water into this ceramic pot, put the top on it.
2) Put it on the burner to low, you only want to warm it up with maybe a light mist coming off it if any, but probably none. 
3) While that's going make another cup and a half of hot Keurig water (or something), ideally straight into your metal / other tea kettle.
4) Carefully pour the brewed tea through its built-in internal filter out the spout into your second stainless steal or other tea kettle. 

![Metal tea kettle for extra filtering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psychological-safety-yogis/InnovaZen/main/screenshots/metal-teapot.png)

1) Pour this tea-water through the second tea kettle's internal filter / spout into your normal pot.  
2) Repeat until the tea is fully swapped over, filtered, and the second hot / warm water is added. 
3) Put normal pot with tea in it (or third large teapot?) on burner, set to about 2.  
4) Error alert: You don't want to cook it down like you're making sugar water for humming birds.  You'll know this mistake when you see it, curling up on the edges with steam coming up out of it.  A quick fix is to add cool, filtered water from the fridge to bring the taste balance and temperature back to normal.     
5) Put hot sink water in your Yeti cannister or whatever thermos you use to bring its internal temp up.
6) When there is some light mist coming up off the tea and it's normal hot coffee temperature, dump the hot sink water out of your thermos and dump in your tea, possibly filtering one last time through the metal tea kettle to get out the little bits.  
7) Enjoy!

4. This is the most important part.  Tamp it down with your nice smooth coffee tamper thing.  Pour some reasonable grounds into the tamped down coffee and tamp it again until the grounds are reasonably tamped.

## Hair and skin products (parasympathetic systems)

### These are near and dear to my heart because I feel they wake up parts of your brain that were asleep.  

##### One side effect of my medications is they invoke a kind of false dementia.  In other words I get some early practice with Alzheimer's. 

##### BUT: Fancy soaps in the shower always seem to either bring up things I'd been trying to remember or new innovative ideas.  

###### Maybe something about hair follicles being so close to the brain.  Anyway, here's the list. 

1. [Dr. Teal's epsom salt and bath products](https://www.target.com/b/dr-teal-s/-/N-4u9fy), although I'm not normally an essential oils believer.

## Medications 
### *Obtain only through lawful prescription by and consultation with a qualified medical professional.

#### Hydroxyzine. 
50mg 4x daily, total 200. Good for mellowing and concentrating, although most people don't really feel it until they go up to 75 per dose. Also great for combatting depression.  Key to dumping memory into recycle bin, both desirable and less desirable.  Creates the blank slate, or "tabula rasa," from which ideas are born.

#### Gabapentin.
300mg 3x daily, 900 total. Good for physical pain, anxiety, depression. Old experienced psychiatric hospital / rehab psychiatrist says it's good for people with a family genetic history of alcoholism, due to our latent gaba deficiency. There is allegedly some research that it regenerates brain / neuron stuff so maybe good for dementia as well.  

#### Sertraline. 
100 in morning and 50 at night. 150 total. Great for anxiety, depression, compulsions. Side effects include happy sunshine, grass, snow.  Pretty much any nature will now appear quite pleasant, probably as it should. Side effects can include excessive spending if you're not careful (no bueno) and not needing to pee in the middle of the night (bueno).

#### Mirtazapine. 
15mg at night. Really helps nightmares (unlike Trazodone, which invokes deep nightmares). Accelerates the good Sertraline effect with less shopaholic side-effect. Good for anxiety and depression while awake as well. 

#### Prazosin. 
10mg at night. 

### *Nighttime Note: Night meds work best taken right before bed, rather than hanging back to enjoy their relaxation effects.  Delay will burn down their positive effects, ultimately netting more nightmares.
